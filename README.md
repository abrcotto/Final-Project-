 My final project is a quiz game to figure out what tiktok meme you are. 
You have to have the images downladed on your computer and in the same file so that the programe can pull the images up.
I watched several youtube videos to help make the images pop up, and a bunch of googling on how to use open cv2. For my functions and list and dictionaries I just looked at all the practice peoblems we did.
To run it have the immages and the cose downloaded in the same file. Then run the program by pressing on the downloded code then answer the questions and the image of what meme you are will pop up, it might be on another tab so make sure to look for it.
